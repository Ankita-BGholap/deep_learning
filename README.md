# deep_learning
In this course I have to understood what is machine learning, how conventional machine learning work, what is supervised and unsupervised learning, the limitation of conventional ML, what is deep learning, difference between DL, ML,AI.I also seen basic math function which is required for deep learning matrices,terminal,eigen value,eigen vector and basic calculas such as derivatives and graideint and also learn what are the term is used in deep learning such nural network,input layer output layer, activation function.After that we also seen differnt framework such as tensorflow, keras,sklearn and some of the appliaction of deep learning.
